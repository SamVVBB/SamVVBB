<h1 align="center">Hello, nice to meet you ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

<p align="center"> "You can't connect the dots looking forward, You can only connect them looking backward." -Steve Jobs </p>

<p> I was involved with both a performing arts center and a journalism class during my high school years. And for as long as I can remember I was always drawing. My passion for art led me to try freelancing and earn some money with my skills. And during this time I looked back at all the the things I enjoyed doing and programs I was apart of, and found an overlap of storytelling.

Through journalism, performing on stage, and art I told stories. And while the thought of it was perhaps whimsical growing up I pondered at what I would do if I could make video games.

Then I pursued my interest in programming and found it quite similar to my art experience. In art a blank canvas has the potential to become anything, and with programming an empty project shows the same potential. It fascinates me and I am excited to learn all the many new things I could possibly create.

While my personal goals are to create my own video games, I am excited to learn from and contribute to a team of professionals in this industry.
